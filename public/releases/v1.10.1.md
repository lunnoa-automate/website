# Version 1.10.1

## New App Integrations & Stability Improvements

This release expands your automation toolkit with three new app integrations while delivering important stability and usability improvements across the platform.

### ✨ New Features

- **Apify Integration**: Connect your workflows to Apify, the powerful web scraping and automation platform. Extract data from websites, run web scrapers, and automate data collection tasks.

- **YouTube Integration**: Access YouTube data in your workflows. Search for videos, retrieve channel information, and incorporate video content into your automation processes.

### 🔧 Improvements
