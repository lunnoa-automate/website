# Version 1.9.0

## Entity Foundation, Objects & Integrations

Take control of your data with powerful new entity management capabilities. This release introduces a flexible system for creating custom data types, managing objects through workflows, and connecting to more business tools.

### ✨ New Features

- **Entity Foundation**: Create and manage custom data types (Entity Types) tailored to your business. Define custom fields, states, and relationships to model any data structure—from deals and contacts to custom assets and resources.

- **Admin Entity Types**: A dedicated administration page for creating, viewing, and managing Entity Types. Build templates for common business objects or create custom types from scratch with flexible field configurations.

- **Objects in Workflows**: Full object support in workflow actions. Create, update, read, and manage objects directly from your automated workflows, enabling true data-driven automation.

- **Process Control Room**: A centralized dashboard for monitoring all your active processes. Track execution status, view timelines, and manage running workflows from one unified view.

- **Linear Integration**: Connect your workflows to Linear, the modern project management tool. Create issues, update project status, and automate task management seamlessly.

- **DealCloud Integration**: Connect your workflows directly to DealCloud CRM. Manage deals, companies, contacts, and all entry types with five core actions: List Entries, Get Entry, Create/Update Entries, Get Schema, and Delete Entry.

### 💡 Use Cases

- **Custom Business Objects**: Model any data structure—client portfolios, product catalogs, equipment inventory, or case management systems
- **Data-Driven Workflows**: Trigger workflows based on object changes or use objects as workflow outputs
- **Process Visibility**: Monitor long-running processes and identify bottlenecks in your automation
- **Project Automation**: Automatically create Linear issues from emails, form submissions, or other triggers
- **Deal Pipeline**: Sync deal information from external systems directly into DealCloud
