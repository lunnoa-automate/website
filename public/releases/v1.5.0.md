# Version 1.5.0

## Workflow Export & Import

Share your workflows with teammates, clients, or across different environments with the new export and import feature.

### ✨ New Features

- **Workflow Export**: Download any workflow as a shareable `.lunnoa-workflow` file. Simply click the menu on any workflow and select "Export" to save it locally. The exported file contains all your workflow configuration while automatically removing sensitive data like credentials.

- **Workflow Import**: Bring workflows into your workspace by clicking the "Import" button on the Workflows page. Drag and drop a `.lunnoa-workflow` file, preview what's included, choose a name and project, and the workflow is created ready for you to configure.

- **Smart Validation**: When importing, the system validates the file format and shows you a preview including the number of nodes and which apps are required, so you know exactly what you're importing before committing.

### 🔧 Improvements

- Imported workflows are created in an inactive state, giving you time to configure connections and review settings before activation
- Export files exclude sensitive credentials and execution data for safe sharing
- New permissions control who can export and import workflows in your workspace

### 💡 Use Cases

- **Consultants**: Create workflow templates and share them with multiple clients
- **Enterprise Teams**: Move workflows from development to production environments
- **Organizations**: Build a library of reusable workflow templates
